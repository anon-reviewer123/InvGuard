VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. Short Address Attack
   - **Description**: The contract is vulnerable to short address attacks where an attacker can send an incorrectly sized transaction.
   - **Affected Function**: `sendCoin`
   - **Exploit Flow**:
     - Attacker manipulates the transaction to use fewer bytes for the address and amount.
     - These short transactions get processed, allowing the attacker to exploit the imbalance.

2. Inefficient Balance Management
   - **Description**: The balance management in the `sendCoin` function can lead to inconsistencies in case of failed transactions.
   - **Affected Function**: `sendCoin`
   - **Exploit Flow**:
     - If the balance is reduced before verifying the transfer, an inconsistency may arise if the transfer fails.

3. Lack of Access Control
   - **Description**: The absence of proper access controls allows any address to send coins on behalf of another.
   - **Affected Function**: `sendCoin`
   - **Exploit Flow**:
     - An unauthorized address can execute a transfer without any checks.


================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. Short Address Attack Exploit
   - **Step 1**: Attacker crafts a transaction with a short address format.
   - **Step 2**: Sends coins using the manipulated address.
   - **Step 3**: Multiple short transactions are processed, draining the balance.

2. Inefficient Balance Management Exploit
   - **Step 1**: Attack sequence where balances are modified without atomic checks.
   - **Step 2**: Exploit inconsistency to perform unauthorized transfers.

3. Lack of Access Control Exploit
   - **Step 1**: Unauthorized address attempts to transfer coins.
   - **Step 2**: Transfer occurs without verification or permission.
   - **Step 3**: Balance inconsistency or unauthorized balance manipulation.
