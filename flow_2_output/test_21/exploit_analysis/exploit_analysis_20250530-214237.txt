ORIGINAL CONTRACT CODE
================================================================================
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

contract EthTxOrderDependenceMinimal {
    address public owner;
    bool public claimed;
    uint public reward;

    function EthTxOrderDependenceMinimal() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setReward() public payable {
        require (!claimed);

        require(msg.sender == owner);
        // <yes> <report> FRONT_RUNNING
        owner.transfer(reward);
        reward = msg.value;
    }

    function claimReward(uint256 submission) {
        require (!claimed);
        require(submission < 10);
        // <yes> <report> FRONT_RUNNING
        msg.sender.transfer(reward);
        claimed = true;
    }
}

VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. Front-Running:
   - `setReward` function allows an owner to set a reward and immediately transfer it before the state update.
   - `claimReward` function exposes a reward that can be claimed, also subject to front-running.

2. Transaction Order Dependence:
   - The logic relies heavily on the order of transactions, making it vulnerable to manipulations.

3. Re-entrancy:
   - Although the typical re-entrancy pattern is not directly present, the `transfer` calls without state updates before external calls can lead to similar attacks.

EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **Front-Running Exploit:**  
   - The attacker can observe the `setReward` transaction and manipulate their own reward claim before the state update happens.
   - This exploit can lead to the attacker receiving a larger reward or manipulating the reward value.

2. **Transaction Order Manipulation:**  
   - The order in which `setReward` and `claimReward` are executed is critical. An attacker can reorder these transactions to their advantage.

3. **Proposed Attack Scenario:**  
   - An attacker could exploit the front-running vulnerability by sending a transaction to `setReward` with a desired value, then quickly claiming it before the owner can act.
