ORIGINAL CONTRACT CODE
================================================================================
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Token {

  mapping(address => uint) balances;
  uint public totalSupply;

  function Token(uint _initialSupply) {
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    // <yes> <report> ARITHMETIC
    require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
    // <yes> <report> ARITHMETIC
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    return true;
  }

  function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
  }
}

================================================================================
VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. **Reentrancy**: Not applicable in this contract as there is no external call in the `transfer` function.

2. **Access Control**: `balances[msg.sender]` and `balances[_to]` are manipulated without checks. No access control on who can call `transfer`.

3. **Data Flow**: The `transfer` function does not validate the recipient address (`_to`). An invalid address can lead to token loss.

4. **Special Storage**: `totalSupply` is assigned in the constructor only and remains constant afterward, which is acceptable.

5. **Money Flow**: The transfer operation can be manipulated if the `_value` is set such that it causes an overflow or an underflow in balances.

6. **Oracle Slippage**: Not applicable as there are no price-related operations in this contract.

7. **Business Logic**: The `transfer` function changes the balance of both the sender and the recipient without atomicity. If an error occurs after deducting from the sender but before adding to the recipient, it may lead to inconsistency.

================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **Reentrancy Attack**: Although this contract is not vulnerable to reentrancy due to the lack of external calls, it is a common vulnerability in similar contracts.

2. **Special Storage Manipulation**: The constructor initializes the `balances[msg.sender]` and `totalSupply` but does not safeguard against improper initialization.

3. **Money Flow Issues**: The transfer function can result in inconsistencies if not all operations succeed. For example, deducting from the sender before adding to the recipient can lead to partial state updates.

4. **Possible Overflows**: In the transfer function, although `require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0)` checks for underflows, there is no equivalent check for recipient balances to prevent potential overflow if `_value` is large enough.

5. **Access Control Failures**: Anyone can call `transfer` as there is no restriction on access. This could lead to unauthorized transfers.
