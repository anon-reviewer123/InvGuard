VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. Access Control Issue
   - Description: The `changeOwner` function can be called by anyone, allowing unauthorized users to change the contract owner.
   - Exploit: Malicious actors can gain control of the contract by changing the owner to their address.
   
2. Missing Ownership Check
   - Description: There is no mechanism to verify the new owner's address before updating the owner.
   - Exploit: An attacker could set an invalid or malicious address as the owner, locking out legitimate users.

================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. Unauthorized Owner Change
   - Steps:
     1. Any user calls the `changeOwner` function with their address as the argument.
     2. The owner is updated to this new address.
     3. The original owner loses control of the contract.
   - Impact: Complete compromise of contract ownership.

2. Owner Lockout Risk
   - Scenario:
     1. An attacker changes the owner to their address and restricts access to the original owner.
     2. The original owner cannot perform any administrative tasks.
   - Impact: Permanent loss of contract control for the original owner.
