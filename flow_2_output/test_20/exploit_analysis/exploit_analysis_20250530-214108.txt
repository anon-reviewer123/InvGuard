================================================================================
ORIGINAL CONTRACT CODE
================================================================================
pragma solidity ^0.4.22;

contract FindThisHash {
    bytes32 constant public hash = 0xb5b5b97fafd9855eec9b41f74dfb6c38f5951141f9a3ecd7f44d5479b630ee0a;

    constructor() public payable {} // load with ether

    function solve(string solution) public {
        // If you can find the pre image of the hash, receive 1000 ether
         // <yes> <report> FRONT_RUNNING
        require(hash == sha3(solution));
        msg.sender.transfer(1000 ether);
    }
}

================================================================================
VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. Front-running: The contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks due to the way it handles the hash comparison.
2. Timing Attack: An attacker might exploit the time delay between the hash computation and the transaction submission.

================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **Exploit Overview:** The attacker can manipulate the order of transactions in the blockchain to ensure their solution is processed first.

2. **Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:**
   - Attacker observes the contract and the hash used in the `solve` function.
   - They compute a valid pre-image (if possible) of the hash or use a brute-force approach to find it.
   - Once they have the pre-image, they send a transaction to the `solve` function.
   - The attacker ensures that their transaction is mined before any other transaction that could alter the contract state.
   - Upon successful execution, they receive 1000 ether as specified in the `solve` function.

3. **Code Location Vulnerabilities:**
   - Line 6: `require(hash == sha3(solution));` - This line is the critical vulnerability. If an attacker can find the hash pre-image, they can exploit it.
