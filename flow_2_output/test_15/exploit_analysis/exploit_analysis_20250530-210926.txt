VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. DENIAL_OF_SERVICE: The `emptyCreditors` function is designed to reset `creditorAddresses` when its length exceeds 1500. However, if this function is never called or fails to execute, the contract will be locked with an increasing array of addresses, leading to gas exhaustion.

2. HIGH_GAS_USAGE: The `addCreditors` function appears to add 350 entries to the `creditorAddresses` array for each call, which can lead to high gas consumption and potential denial of service.

3. LOGIC_FLAW: The `emptyCreditors` function checks if the length exceeds 1500 to reset the array. This arbitrary limit may not effectively manage the state, especially if multiple calls are made before it executes.

================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:**  
   a. An attacker calls `addCreditors` multiple times to fill the `creditorAddresses` array.  
   b. Once the array reaches a sufficient length, the attacker hopes to exploit the `emptyCreditors` function to reset the addresses when the count exceeds 1500.  
   c. If `emptyCreditors` isnâ€™t called, or the condition isn&#39;t met, the contract becomes unusable due to the gas-heavy operations in the array.  

2. **Potential Impact Assessment:**  
   a. The denial of service could lock the contract state, making functions like `numberCreditors` and `iWin` unreliable.  
   b. High gas usage might lead to failed transactions and inability to reset the state without manual intervention.  
   c. Logic flaws in the reset condition could allow an attacker to manipulate the execution path.
