ORIGINAL CONTRACT CODE
================================================================================
pragma solidity ^0.4.10;

contract IntegerOverflowAdd {
    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    // INSECURE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public{
        /* Check if sender has balance */
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
        // <yes> <report> ARITHMETIC
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;
}
}

================================================================================
VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. **Reentrancy**: The `transfer` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. An attacker can exploit the lack of state updates before external calls to repeatedly call the `transfer` function.
2. **Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow**: The contract does not use SafeMath or similar protection against overflow or underflow issues in arithmetic operations.
3. **Access Control**: There is no access control on the `transfer` function, which allows any user to initiate a transfer regardless of their balance.
4. **Money Flow**: The contract lacks proper checks and balances for value transfers, making it susceptible to manipulative transfers by malicious actors.

================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **Reentrancy Attack Flow**:
   - Attacker has an initial balance and calls `transfer` to send funds.
   - Before the state update (balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;), the attacker can re-enter the `transfer` function.
   - Multiple recursive calls can drain funds from the contract.

2. **Overflow/Underflow Scenario**:
   - If `_value` is large enough, `balanceOf[msg.sender]` can underflow, allowing the attacker to transfer funds they do not own.

3. **Access Control Issue**:
   - Any address can call the `transfer` function without validation, leading to potential unauthorized transfers.

4. **Exploit Impact**:
   - Total loss of funds for the sender or contract, depending on exploit flow.
