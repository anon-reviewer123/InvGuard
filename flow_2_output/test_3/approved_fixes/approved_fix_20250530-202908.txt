Approved Smart Contract Fix
Generated At: 2025-05-30 20:29:08

================================================================================
FIX DESCRIPTION
================================================================================
The fix includes adding necessary checks in the `newOwner` function to ensure that only existing owners can add new owners. Additionally, a reentrancy guard has been implemented in the `withdrawAll` function to prevent reentrant attacks. The function now safely transfers funds without being vulnerable to multiple recursive calls.

================================================================================
INVARIANTS CONSIDERED
================================================================================
1. Access Control Invariants:
   - Ensures that only authorized owners can perform critical operations like adding or deleting owners.

2. Reentrancy Invariants:
   - Protects against reentrant attacks during the execution of `withdrawAll`, ensuring funds are transferred safely.

3. Ownership Invariants:
   - Maintains a valid ownership hierarchy, preventing unauthorized changes to owner mappings.
