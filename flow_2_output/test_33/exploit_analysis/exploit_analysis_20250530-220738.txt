ORIGINAL CONTRACT CODE
================================================================================
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract Governmental {
  address public owner;
  address public lastInvestor;
  uint public jackpot = 1 ether;
  uint public lastInvestmentTimestamp;
  uint public ONE_MINUTE = 1 minutes;

  function Governmental() {
    owner = msg.sender;
    if (msg.value<1 ether) throw;
  }

  function invest() {
    if (msg.value<jackpot/2) throw;
    lastInvestor = msg.sender;
    jackpot += msg.value/2;
    // <yes> <report> TIME_MANIPULATION
    lastInvestmentTimestamp = block.timestamp;
  }

contract Attacker {

  function attack(address target, uint count) {

      this.attack.gas(msg.gas-2000)(target, count+1);

VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. **Time Manipulation**: The use of `block.timestamp` for critical time-based logic can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to alter the contractâ€™s behavior. 
2. **Reentrancy**: The `resetInvestment` function calls `lastInvestor.send(jackpot)` before it nullifies `lastInvestor`. This allows an attacker to re-enter the function before the state update, potentially causing multiple withdrawals.
3. **Gas Limit and Loops**: The `attack` function in the `Attacker` contract exploits recursive calls with diminishing gas to bypass the gas limit, allowing it to perform actions in a loop until a condition is met (count < 1023).

================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **Exploit Overview**: An attacker can manipulate the investment flow and reset the contract's state without proper checks, especially using recursive calls to bypass logic checks.
2. **Reentrancy Attack Flow**:
   - Attacker invests to become the `lastInvestor`.
   - On `resetInvestment`, before the state variables are reset, the attacker can re-enter and exploit the send operation to withdraw funds multiple times.
3. **Time Manipulation Flow**:
   - By controlling the block timestamp or strategically timing transactions, an attacker can ensure they are able to reset investments or manipulate jackpot values.
