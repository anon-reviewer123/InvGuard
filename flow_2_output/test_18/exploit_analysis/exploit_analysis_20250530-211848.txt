ORIGINAL CONTRACT CODE
================================================================================
pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract Refunder {
    
address[] private refundAddresses;
mapping (address => uint) public refunds;

    constructor() {
        refundAddresses.push(0x79B483371E87d664cd39491b5F06250165e4b184);

    }

    // bad
    function refundAll() public {
        for(uint x; x < refundAddresses.length; x++) { // arbitrary length iteration based on how many addresses participated
        // <yes> <report> DENIAL_OF_SERVICE
            require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]])); // doubly bad, now a single failure on send will hold up all funds

VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. Denial of Service (DoS): The `refundAll` function can be exploited to cause a DoS by manipulating the refund flow, preventing subsequent operations.
2. Re-entrancy: Although the function does not directly call itself, it relies on external calls (`send` function) within a loop, making it vulnerable to re-entrant attacks.
3. Arbitrary Length Iteration: The loop iterates over `refundAddresses`, which can be arbitrarily long, leading to potential gas exhaustion and DoS.
4. Single Point of Failure: If any `send` call in the loop fails, it will halt the entire `refundAll` process, leading to an incomplete refund operation.

================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **Exploit Overview**: The `refundAll` function loops through `refundAddresses` and attempts to send refunds. If any external call (`send`) fails, the entire loop halts, causing a DoS.

2. **Attack Scenario**:
   - Attacker manipulates the order of refunds or one of the refund addresses to cause a failure in the `send` operation.
   - This results in all subsequent refunds being skipped or not processed as intended.

3. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Funds may be locked in the contract indefinitely if `refundAll` is interrupted.
   - Attackers can exploit this to prevent legitimate refunds from occurring.

4. **Vulnerability Locations**:
   - `refundAll` function: The loop is susceptible to external call vulnerabilities, particularly `send` operations.
