ORIGINAL CONTRACT CODE
================================================================================
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

 /* User can add pay in and withdraw Ether.
    Unfortunatly, the developer was drunk and used the wrong comparison operator in "withdraw()"
    Anybody can withdraw arbitrary amounts of Ether :()

================================================================================
VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. **Access Control**: 
   - **Issue**: The `withdraw` function allows users to withdraw an arbitrary amount of Ether, which is a critical access control flaw. 
   - **Affected Line**: 30
   - **Exploit Detail**: Any user can call `withdraw` with a value greater than their balance, leading to unauthorized fund withdrawal.

2. **Access Control**: 
   - **Issue**: The `migrateTo` function can only be executed by the contract creator, which is appropriate, but it may transfer all funds without further checks. 
   - **Affected Line**: 43
   - **Exploit Detail**: If the creator's address is compromised, an attacker can migrate all funds to an arbitrary address.

3. **Re-entrancy**: 
   - **Issue**: The `withdraw` function is susceptible to re-entrancy attacks due to the order of operations. 
   - **Affected Line**: 30
   - **Exploit Detail**: An attacker can exploit the `transfer` call to recursively withdraw funds before the balance is updated.

================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **Exploit Type**: Re-entrancy 
   - **Vulnerability Location**: `withdraw` function  
   - **Attack Flow**:  
     1. Attacker deposits funds into the wallet.  
     2. Attacker initiates a `withdraw` call for the full balance.  
     3. The contract transfers funds to the attacker before updating the balance.  
     4. Attacker repeats the `withdraw` call recursively until the contract is drained.

2. **Exploit Type**: Access Control  
   - **Vulnerability Location**: `migrateTo` function  
   - **Attack Flow**:  
     1. Creator initiates the `migrateTo` call.  
     2. All funds are transferred to the specified address without verification.

3. **Exploit Type**: Data Flow  
   - **Vulnerability Location**: `deposit` function  
   - **Attack Flow**:  
     1. An attacker can manipulate the deposit amount to overflow or underflow the balance.  
     2. This can lead to inconsistent states or unauthorized withdrawals.
