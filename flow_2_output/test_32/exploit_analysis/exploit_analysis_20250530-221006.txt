ORIGINAL CONTRACT CODE
================================================================================

/// @title Ethereum Lottery Game.

contract EtherLotto {

    // Amount of ether needed for participating in the lottery.
    uint constant TICKET_AMOUNT = 10;

    // Fixed amount fee for each lottery game.
    uint constant FEE_AMOUNT = 1;

    // Address where fee is sent.
    address public bank;

    // Public jackpot that each participant can win (minus fee).
    uint public pot;

    // Lottery constructor sets bank account from the smart-contract owner.
    function EtherLotto() {
        bank = msg.sender;
    }

    // Public function for playing lottery. Each time this function
    // is invoked, the sender has an oportunity for winning pot.

        // Participants must spend some fixed ether before playing lottery.
        assert(msg.value == TICKET_AMOUNT);

        // Increase pot for each participant.
        pot += msg.value;

        var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;

        // Distribution: 50% of participants will be winners.
        if (random == 0) {

            // Send fee to bank account.
            bank.transfer(FEE_AMOUNT);

            // Send jackpot to winner.
            msg.sender.transfer(pot - FEE_AMOUNT);

VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. **Time Manipulation**: The use of `block.timestamp` for randomness makes the contract susceptible to time manipulation attacks. 
2. **Reentrancy**: The `msg.sender.transfer()` call can lead to reentrancy issues, allowing an attacker to recursively call `play()` before the state update.
3. **Insufficient Value Check**: The assertion `assert(msg.value == TICKET_AMOUNT)` does not adequately validate the message value, as it can be bypassed with a manipulated transaction.
4. **Oracle Attack (Randomness Manipulation)**: An attacker could influence the `sha3(block.timestamp)` to predict or manipulate the random value for their advantage.
5. **Jackpot Drain Risk**: If the `pot` value is small, an attacker can leverage the contract to repeatedly drain it with minimal fees.


================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **Time Manipulation Attack**:
   - By manipulating the blockâ€™s timestamp, an attacker can control the randomness used for winner selection.
   - For example, by waiting for a specific block time, they can ensure `random == 0` to win the jackpot.

2. **Reentrancy Attack**:
   - An attacker can exploit the `msg.sender.transfer(pot - FEE_AMOUNT)` call. If the attacker can re-enter the `play()` function, they can drain the pot.
   - This can be achieved by deploying a malicious contract that calls `play()` again during the transfer.

3. **Oracle Attack**:
   - Similar to time manipulation, an attacker can predict the output of `sha3(block.timestamp)` if they control block formation or can analyze previous transactions.

4. **Front-Running**:
   - An attacker can watch the mempool for pending transactions and insert their own transaction with higher gas to win the lottery.

5. **Jackpot Drain with Low Value**:
   - If the pot value is low, an attacker can repeatedly call `play()` with minimal funds to drain the pot without paying the full ticket amount.
