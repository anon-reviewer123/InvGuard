================================================================================
VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The contract is vulnerable to a DoS attack due to the use of `send` for refunds. If the `send` call fails (for example, if the fallback function of the recipient reverts), the frontrunner can block the auction by not accepting refunds.

2. **Insecure External Call**: The contract performs an external call to `currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid)`, which can be exploited if the called contract has malicious logic.

================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **Attack Vector**: Frontrunner exploitation of the `send` method to perpetuate a DoS attack.

2. **Step-by-Step Scenario**:
   - A malicious user (frontrunner) places a bid just before another user to obtain the highest bid.
   - When they are outbid, the contract attempts to send the current bid amount back to them.
   - If the malicious user's fallback function is written to revert on receiving ether, the entire `send` call will fail.
   - This causes the auction to become unusable as the frontrunner remains in place without accepting refunds.

3. **Potential Impact**: Auction contract becomes non-functional, leading to loss of bids and trust in the contract.
