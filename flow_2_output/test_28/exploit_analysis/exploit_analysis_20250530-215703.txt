VULNERABILITIES FOUND
================================================================================
1. REENTRANCY: The `CashOut` function allows reentrant calls. This can lead to multiple withdrawals before the state is updated.
2. ACCESS CONTROL: `CashOut` does not properly restrict who can withdraw funds. Any address can request a withdrawal for any balance.
3. TIME DEPENDENCY: The `lastBlock` variable is used to prevent reentrancy, but it is not reliable as an anti-reentrancy measure.
4. LOGIC FLAW: `Deposit` has a condition that requires a minimum deposit, but this can be easily bypassed if the smart contract is called with a value above `MinDeposit`.

================================================================================
EXPLOIT DETAILS
================================================================================
1. **REENTRANCY ATTACK**:
   - An attacker can exploit the `CashOut` function by repeatedly calling it before the state change (updating the balance) occurs.
   - This leads to multiple deductions from the balance and unauthorized fund transfers.
2. **EXPLOIT FLOW**:
   - Attacker deposits funds to create a balance.
   - Initiates a `CashOut` operation that erroneously allows reentrant calls.
   - By invoking the `call.value` in a fallback function, the attacker can repeatedly exploit the withdrawal logic.
3. **POTENTIAL IMPACT**:
   - Drastic reduction in contract balance due to repeated withdrawals.
   - Compromise of transaction history integrity as reentrant calls disrupt logical flow.
