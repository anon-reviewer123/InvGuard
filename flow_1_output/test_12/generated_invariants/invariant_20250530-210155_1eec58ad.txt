Contract Code Snippet:
// Make a bet
    function makeBet() {
        // Won if block number is even
        // (note: this is a terrible source of randomness, please don't use this with real money)
        // <yes> <report> BAD_RANDOMNESS
        bool won = (block.number % 2) == 0;

Generated Invariant:
msg.value > 0 => block.number % 2 == 0 || block.number % 2 == 1
